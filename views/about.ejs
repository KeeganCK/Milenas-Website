            <h1>About the maker of the site and the site itself</h1>
            <hr>
            <p class="lead">My name is Keegan Kavanagh, I am a third year software engineering student at the University of Victoria. I made this site by accident, I started to make it because my girlfriend wanted tea everynight.
                This was just suppposed to be a simple site with one button that picked a random tea. But in the end, I realized I really enjoyed making a website, so I continued and continued and continued. I started to learn more and more and wanted to
                use what I learned, to really understand it. That is how this site became what it is now.
